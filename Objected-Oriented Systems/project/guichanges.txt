+- GUI status box should not be editable

+- put in default "Set Movement Mode label" for movement mode button if there isn't a mode chosen yet

+- put in "Turn Mech" label for set of arrows turning mech

+- does status box always auto-scroll?

+- left mech cannot move very close to right mech (possible battletech rules error)

+- larger turn increments

+- remove "Exception" prefix for weapon firing exceptions

- change terrain and woods colors

- add "Weapon hits" message for successful weapon fire

- each update should rename weapon buttons and remove extras, because weapons may have been destroyed.  consider associating buttons with specific weapon names, instead of weapon numbers

- <continued from previous point>  do this:

	final String weaponName = theGame.getOwnMech(myName).getWeapons().getWeapon(i).getName();

	then insde the actionPerformed:

	String output = tempWeapons.fireWeapon(weaponName, theGame.getOtherMech(myName));

- throw more exceptions

- dan's dialog box

- display target range, either in pixels range or hexes

+- display target elevation and my own elevation

- do not cover up internal structure color with armor color

- mechwarrior consciousness

- weapon Ammo, Location, Damage, Heat (consider putting in extended weapon info in another tab?)

- punch and kick damage, on the respective buttons

- current firing and movement penalties due to heat (ask benny for methods)

- guide lines for moving forward and backward, preferably pretty long ones
