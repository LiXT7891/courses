Project Info Tidbits:

1) I implemented one more rule than was stated - The first word played in the game must begin, or go through, square H8.

2) For the Part I of the project, please ask Sid for it; i didn't have time to package it properly and so i just sent the whole thing to Sid last monday night.  Panic-induced reaction, i suppose.
