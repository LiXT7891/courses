Homework 9

To set up for the test script, have a supervisor, 3 peers, and an interactive rune window running as follows:

rune supervisor.e S
rune peer.e A
rune peer.e B
rune peer.e C
rune

The interactive rune window must be started in the same directory where you ran the above commands, as otherwise the *.cap files will not be found.

Ping displays will be in the individual supervisor/peer windows.

Enqueue/dequeue displays will always be in the supervisor's window.

Should hopefully work in Barley :)
