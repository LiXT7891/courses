Homework 4

Some assumptions I made:
1. It is ok to traverse subdomains of the cs.jhu.edu domain, such as ugrad.cs.jhu.edu.
2. An implicit goal is to find as much contact info in as little time as possible.  The relevance function implemented in robot_base.pl was written with that goal in mind.
3. It is ok to contact a server around once a second.  The minute delay was way too long for development purposes.  Current setting is robot->delay(0.02).
