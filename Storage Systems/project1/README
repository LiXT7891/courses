Project 1 README
Zachary Peterson (zachary@cs.jhu.edu)

Included here should be all the tools you need to generate
experiments and extract results for Project 1.  I've
included a Makefile that shows how to link to the DiskSim
library; feel free to use it.  

project1.h contains prototypes for any and all system calls 
needed for this project, as well as pretty detailed description
of each call.

The disk being simulated is the Seagate Barracuda (ST32171W),
similar to one of the drives seen in the Talagala paper.

Please contact me with any questions.
